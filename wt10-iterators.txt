Iterators are the reason that...
  for x in y:
...has the syntax it does. 

Behind the scenes, we have an iterator object created on loop declaration which is handling the role 
traditionally played by explicit declarations of (i=0; (bool condition); i++)

the 'in' part is (I believe) what is evaluating truthiness
i.e. as long as function next() called on the iterator object has a truthy return value, then the loop
continues for one more round of execution.



enumerate()

dictionary def of english word: "mention (a number of things) one by one"

standard method - it takes an iterator object as input, and returns the index/count AND value.
You should use this to track index more easily
